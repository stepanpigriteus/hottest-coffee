Introduction
Managing a coffee shop involves juggling multiple tasks: taking orders, tracking inventory, updating the menu, and ensuring customer satisfaction. The hot-coffee project is a simplified coffee shop management system designed to provide hands-on experience with backend development, RESTful API design, and data management using Go.

Project Overview
hot-coffee is a command-line application that starts an HTTP server to manage a coffee shop's operations. It allows staff to:

Manage Orders: Create, retrieve, update, and delete customer orders.
Oversee Inventory: Track ingredient stock levels to prevent shortages.
Update the Menu: Add new menu items, adjust prices, and manage offerings.
Generate Reports: View total sales and popular menu items.
This project is a practical exploration of how order management and inventory systems operate under the hood, including how they handle data processing, manage concurrent requests, and ensure data integrity.

Features
RESTful API: Provides endpoints to manage orders, menu items, and inventory.
JSON Data Handling: Encodes and decodes JSON data for seamless data transmission.
Data Storage with JSON Files: Stores data locally in JSON files without the need for a database.
Layered Architecture: Implements a three-layered architecture for clean code and scalability.
Logging: Uses Go's log/slog package to record significant events and errors.
Aggregations: Provides endpoints to retrieve total sales and popular menu items.
Architecture
The application is built using a three-layered architecture:

Presentation Layer (Handlers)

Responsibilities:
Handle HTTP requests and responses.
Parse input data and format output data.
Invoke appropriate methods from the Business Logic Layer.
Implementation Details:
Handlers are organized based on entities (e.g., order_handler.go, menu_handler.go, inventory_handler.go).
Uses Go's net/http package to set up routes and handle requests.
Validates input data and returns meaningful error messages.
Business Logic Layer (Services)

Responsibilities:
Implement core business logic and rules.
Define interfaces for services to promote decoupling.
Perform data processing and call methods from the Data Access Layer.
Handle aggregations and computations based on business requirements.
Implementation Details:
Defines service interfaces (e.g., OrderService, MenuService, InventoryService) in separate files.
Implements methods for aggregations (e.g., GetTotalSales, GetPopularMenuItems).
Ensures that services are independent and can be tested in isolation.
Data Access Layer (Repositories)

Responsibilities:
Manage data storage and retrieval operations.
Interact with JSON files to persist and read data.
Ensure data integrity and consistency.
Provide interfaces for repositories to allow flexibility.
Implementation Details:
Creates repository interfaces for each entity (e.g., OrderRepository, MenuRepository, InventoryRepository).
Implements these interfaces.
Organizes data in separate JSON files for each entity, stored in the data/ directory.

Orders
GET /orders: Retrieve all orders.
GET /orders/{id}: Retrieve a specific order by ID.
PUT /orders/{id}: Update an existing order.
DELETE /orders/{id}: Delete an order.
POST /orders/{id}/close: Close an order.
Menu Items
POST /menu: Add a new menu item.
GET /menu: Retrieve all menu items.
GET /menu/{id}: Retrieve a specific menu item.
PUT /menu/{id}: Update a menu item.
DELETE /menu/{id}: Delete a menu item.
Inventory
POST /inventory: Add a new inventory item.
GET /inventory: Retrieve all inventory items.
GET /inventory/{id}: Retrieve a specific inventory item.
PUT /inventory/{id}: Update an inventory item.
DELETE /inventory/{id}: Delete an inventory item.
Aggregations
GET /reports/total-sales: Get the total sales amount.
GET /reports/popular-items: Get a list of popular menu items.
Data Storage with JSON Files
No Database Usage
The application stores all data locally in JSON files without using a database system. Data is persisted in the following files within the data/ directory:

orders.json: Stores information about customer orders.
menu_items.json: Stores details about the products available in the coffee shop.
inventory.json: Stores inventory of ingredients required to prepare menu items.
Examples of JSON Files
orders.json

    "order_id": "order123",
    "customer_name": "Alice Smith",
    "items": [
